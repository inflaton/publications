%This study investigates the relationship between social media sentiment, engagement levels, and the success of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). With the advent of social network technology, the opinions of the masses have become increasingly influential and this has had great implications for business, marketing and fundraising. This is particularly prevalent in the blockchain space, where Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are highly publicised on the interwebs. As such, we posit a positive correlation between the manifestation of favorable sentiment within tweets referencing an ICO and the overall success of said ICO. We also posit that the extent of social media engagement, encompassing key metrics such as mentions, retweets, likes, and follower counts, is likewise a pivotal indicator of ICO success. To empirically validate these hypotheses, we adopt a machine learning approach by using sentiment analysis to discern and categorize the emotional nuances within tweets, distinguishing between expressions of positivity and negativity. We also employ well-known classification methods to scrutinize engagement data and its relationship with ICO interest and awareness. The findings yield valuable insights on the predictive efficacy of social media strategies for ICO success, and underscore the importance of investor sentiment and engagement within the volatile, narrative-driven cryptocurrency landscape, which can enhance future crypto founders' business development efforts.

With the advent of social network technology, the influence of collective opinions has significantly impacted business, marketing, and fundraising. Particularly in the blockchain space, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) gain substantial exposure across various online platforms. Yet, the intricate relationships among these elements remain largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate the relationships between social media sentiment, engagement metrics, and ICO success. We hypothesize a positive correlation between favorable sentiment in ICO-related tweets and overall project success. Additionally, we recognize social media engagement indicators (mentions, retweets, likes, follower counts) as critical factors affecting ICO performance. Employing machine learning techniques, we conduct sentiment analysis on tweets, discerning emotional nuances and categorizing expressions as positive or negative. Employing established classification methods, we further analyze engagement data to reveal its impact on ICO interest and awareness. Our research findings offer insights into the predictive potential of social media strategies for ICO success and underscore the importance of investor sentiment and engagement in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. These insights provide actionable guidance for aspiring crypto founders in formulating effective business development strategies.

\section{Introduction}

%The advent of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has revolutionized fundraising strategies, giving rise to innovative methods like Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) \cite{campino2021initial}. ICOs, alternatively known as token sales or crowd sales, have emerged as cost-effective and easily accessible avenues for raising capital. These smart contract-based fundraising mechanisms, relying on blockchain technology, involve the creation of new coins, which are then offered for sale on dedicated platforms. Notably, social media channels such as Twitter have played a pivotal role in amplifying awareness and dissemination of information regarding both ICOs and IEOs \cite{tiwari2020future}.

%IEOs represent a distinct facet of crowdfunding facilitated by cryptocurrency exchanges, where these exchanges manage fundraising campaigns on behalf of businesses seeking capital through the issuance of new tokens \cite{chamorro2021financing}. Functioning as intermediaries between projects and investors, cryptocurrency exchanges offer comprehensive crowd sale services \cite{vivion2020supporting}. This model has catalyzed substantial funding for ICOs, evident in the launch of 3,782 ICOs in 2018 alone, collectively raising nearly \$11.4 billion \cite{boreiko2019new}, \cite{giudici2019impact}. Coincodex has hosted 113 ICOs, underscoring the continued prevalence of this fundraising method in 2021 \cite{giudici2019impact}, \cite{daskalakis2020introduction}. Notably, the foundation of an ICO lies in its whitepaper, a precursor that outlines key project details, including business strategy, blockchain platform, token sale structure, token distribution, fund allocation, team composition, and a roadmap for project development \cite{daskalakis2020introduction}. Leveraging the expansive reach of social media, ICOs frequently turn to platforms like Twitter to promote and amplify their offerings within the crypto community \cite{drobetz2019investor}.

The emergence of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has transformed fundraising through methods like Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) \cite{campino2021initial}. ICOs, also known as token sales, provide cost-effective fundraising avenues by issuing new coins on blockchain-based platforms. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have significantly contributed to the promotion and dissemination of information about both ICOs and IEOs \cite{tiwari2020future}.

IEOs, facilitated by cryptocurrency exchanges, involve these platforms managing fundraising campaigns by issuing new tokens \cite{chamorro2021financing}. Acting as intermediaries between projects and investors, these exchanges offer comprehensive crowd sale services \cite{vivion2020supporting}. The ICO model witnessed substantial funding, with 3,782 ICOs launched in 2018 alone, collectively raising nearly \$11.4 billion \cite{boreiko2019new}, \cite{giudici2019impact}. Despite fluctuations, the prevalence of ICOs persisted in 2021, with 113 hosted on Coincodex \cite{giudici2019impact}, \cite{daskalakis2020introduction}. The foundation of an ICO rests on its whitepaper, outlining project details such as business strategy, token sale structure, fund allocation, team composition, and development roadmap \cite{daskalakis2020introduction}. Utilizing the broad reach of social media, ICOs frequently leverage platforms like Twitter to promote their offerings within the crypto community \cite{drobetz2019investor}.




%To heighten public awareness surrounding emerging ICOs or IEOs, businesses deploy strategic marketing approaches, such as Airdrop initiatives. Airdrop involves incentivizing participants in marketing activities with complimentary digital tokens or cryptocurrency. Enthusiasts are encouraged to engage in community-building actions, such as joining Telegram groups and following on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. By amplifying their involvement through activities like retweeting and tagging friends, participants not only earn rewards but also contribute to fostering community engagement and garnering brand endorsement from customers \cite{howell2020initial}. Undoubtedly, social media platforms, prominently Twitter, emerge as indispensable tools for the success of ICOs and IEOs, providing a swift, cost-effective, and readily accessible means to raise capital. Leveraging the efficiency of blockchain technology, the creation of new digital tokens becomes a rapid and instantaneous process through the implementation of smart contracts. This not only ensures cost savings but also upholds the paramount values of security and dependability \cite{morkunas2019blockchain}

%Previous studies in the field of ICOs and IEOs have mainly focused on direct mentions on social media, neglecting the potential impact of indirect interactions. Specifically, related works have only studied sentiments from direct tweets that explicitly mention a crypto project. This approach overlooks a significant portion of social media interactions, including replies to tweets that mention the token keyword and replies to announcements from the project's Twitter account. To address this gap in the literature, this study aims to explore social media sentiment and engagement more extensively, covering both direct and indirect interactions surrounding crypto projects. We will investigate the number of followers of users who are still likely to be exposed to the crypto projects' news, as well as sentiment expressed in direct and indirect mentions. Our study aims to predict ICOs success using social media sentiment and engagement levels. The results of this prediction will shed light on the relationship between success and social media sentiment and engagement. Our study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the success of ICOs and IEOs in the social media sphere.

Businesses utilize Airdrop initiatives to increase awareness about emerging ICOs or IEOs, rewarding participants with digital tokens or cryptocurrency for engaging in marketing activities. This involves actions like joining Telegram groups, following on social media platforms, retweeting, and tagging friends, fostering community engagement and brand endorsement \cite{howell2020initial}. Social media, especially Twitter, plays a vital role in the success of ICOs and IEOs, offering swift, cost-effective means to raise capital, supported by blockchain's efficiency in creating digital tokens through smart contracts, ensuring security and reliability \cite{morkunas2019blockchain}.

Existing studies on ICOs and IEOs often focus solely on direct social media mentions, neglecting the potential impact of indirect interactions. This study aims to bridge this gap by comprehensively analyzing both direct and indirect social media interactions related to crypto projects. It explores sentiment and engagement levels in direct tweets, replies mentioning token keywords, and project announcements on Twitter. By predicting ICOs success using social media sentiment and engagement, this study seeks to uncover their interrelation, offering insights into the factors influencing ICOs and IEOs success on social media.


The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We make use of well-documented machine learning classification methods to conduct empirical experiments, and confirm the intuition that sentiment and engagement are highly predictive of cryptocurrency project fundraising success, both individually and as a joint hypothesis.
    \item We highlight the fundamental factors that have historically driven ICO success, from marketing to governance and venture funding. We also flag potential roadblocks in using social media for crypto project sentiment analysis, namely the introduction of bot tweets and paid advertising that may not reflect true sentiment.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work \& Motivations}
ICOs have become a popular means for startups to raise funds. However, the success of ICOs is influenced by various factors that need to be considered for a comprehensive understanding of their fundraising outcomes. Several studies have investigated these factors and identified different predictors of success.

%Study \cite{campino2021success} identified third-party ratings and the disclosure of key information in the whitepaper as significant predictors of ICO success. Additionally, the study emphasized the importance of the secondary market, expensive tokens with bonus schemes, shorter campaigns, a well-managed Twitter campaign, and larger teams. Although this study provides practical recommendations for startups to improve their chances of achieving successful fundraising outcomes, it has a disadvantage as it does not focus on the impact of social media (sentiment and engagement) on ICO success, which has become an increasingly important factor in recent years.

%One study highlighted predictors like third-party ratings, detailed whitepapers, and social media influence \cite{campino2021success}. However, it lacks insight into the growing impact of social media on ICO outcomes.

One study\cite{campino2021success} identifies key predictors of ICO success, including third-party ratings, detailed whitepapers, and social media influence. However, our critique is aimed at the depth of analysis provided on the influence of social media; specifically, we believe the study does not adequately explore the evolving role and increasing significance of social media dynamics on ICO outcomes.

%Study \cite{campino2021success} confirmed that the quality signals provided by project promoters, the amount of quality information disclosed in the whitepaper, and social media are crucial factors contributing to the success of ICOs. However, it has limitations, such as not considering the fact that most mainstream and retail crypto investors do not research or care about token whitepapers, which can be too technical and complicated for the average person. Therefore, having a good bonus scheme and a high-quality founding team can only attract institutional investors, as the average retail investor often only follows what they see on social media and through word-of-mouth.

%In another study \cite{alchykava2021ico}, the importance of providing detailed information about financial goals, the uniqueness of the idea, practical significance, cost structure, and the competencies and experience of the team members to increase the investment attractiveness of an ICO project was highlighted. This study emphasizes the need for more public information to build investor confidence and attract more investment. However, the study did not address the impact of social media on ICO success, which could be a significant factor to consider, given that common people often follow trends and what they see on their feeds on a daily basis.

Another study emphasized detailed project information, idea uniqueness, and team competencies \cite{alchykava2021ico}, yet overlooked the significance of social media's sway on investor behavior.

%Study \cite{belitski2022success} focused on increasing ICO credibility and transparency and identified three boundary conditions that can enhance ICO credibility and transparency: registering the ICO and publishing the project's code on GitHub, obtaining VC or business angel financing before or during the presale, and publishing the whitepaper before the start of the campaign. Although these measures can help combat the prevalence of fraudulent ICOs and increase investor confidence in the market, the study did not explore the potential drawbacks of these measures, such as the cost and effort involved in obtaining VC or business angel financing or the potential risks associated with making the project's code publicly available on GitHub.

A different study identified conditions to bolster ICO credibility, including registration, GitHub code publication, and early funding \cite{belitski2022success}. However, it overlooks potential drawbacks like the effort in obtaining funding and risks in code transparency.

%Finally, study \cite{lyandres2020ico} found a positive relationship between ICO hardcap and funding success, as well as the positive effect of whitepaper informativeness on ICO success. The study also highlighted the importance of pre-ICO social media activity and the presence of bonuses. Additionally, ICO transparency, indicated by including a know-your-customer provision, was found to be significantly positively related to both the minimal ICO funding success indicator and the amount raised in an ICO. However, the study has some limitations, as it is restricted to a specific time period, and its conclusions may not be generalizable to other contexts. Furthermore, the study did not explore the impact of negative sentiment on ICO funding success, which can also play a significant role in determining the success of an ICO.

Study \cite{lyandres2020ico} identified ICO success factors including hardcap, whitepaper informativeness, pre-ICO social media activity, bonuses, and transparency. However, its limited time scope and absence of negative sentiment impact are noteworthy limitations.

%The incorporation of sentiment analysis on Twitter has evolved into an indispensable tool for assessing the efficacy of ICOs. Harnessing the sentiments expressed in Twitter comments offers a pragmatic avenue to amplify customer voices, thereby enhancing competitiveness in the global market \cite{albrecht2020behavior}. In the expansive landscape of social media, various platforms are utilized for product advertising and engaging with potential customers. Twitter, a widely popular global social networking site, allows users to convey concise messages within a 280-character limit and share audio messages up to 140 seconds, facilitating instant connections through tweets, retweets, and the strategic use of hashtags. The platform proves highly efficient in fostering discussions, evident in its 4:1 feedback ratio for each conversation initiated on the platform \cite{mohd2020liability}.

Twitter sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in evaluating ICO effectiveness \cite{albrecht2020behavior}. The platform's global reach facilitates succinct communication, fostering high engagement rates \cite{mohd2020liability}. Analyzing meticulously collected Twitter comments related to ICOs, sentiment analysis unveils behavioral and social sentiment patterns among investors. These insights serve as a foundation for devising effective marketing strategies \cite{calderwood2019travel}.


%In the current landscape of digital marketing, leveraging influencers to disseminate tweets about products and services has become a prevalent trend. Influencers wield the power to shape social media perceptions, significantly influencing brand trustworthiness and, consequently, consumer purchasing decisions. Engaging conversations on Twitter emerges as a dynamic strategy to bolster brand recognition, stimulate brand discussions, attract new audiences, and foster a broader discourse. As underscored by a Twitter study, a mere 10\% increase in product or brand conversations can yield a substantial 3\% uptick in sales \cite{appel2020future}. In the context of this study, the predictive power of sentiment analysis on tweets is harnessed to gauge the fundraising success of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). A meticulous collection of Twitter comments related to ICOs fuels data analysis, with sentiment analysis offering insights into the behavioral and social sentiment patterns of investors. This comprehensive understanding serves as the bedrock for the formulation of effective marketing strategies \cite{calderwood2019travel}.

%To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing ICO success, a study that solely focuses on the impact of social media (sentiment and engagement) on crypto ICOs success is required. In contrast to the study in \cite{chursook2022twitter}, which focuses on the impact of Twitter sentiment and expert ratings on the success of ICOs specifically in the Australian and Singaporean markets, our research broadens the scope to a global context, examining how various social media strategies such as influencer marketing, community management, and paid advertising influence the fundraising outcomes of ICOs worldwide. Additionally, a study that focuses on the impact of social media on ICO success could provide valuable insights into how startups can develop effective marketing strategies. As social media becomes an increasingly important platform for engaging with potential investors, understanding the impact of social media sentiment and engagement on ICO success can help startups to better target and engage with their audience. By analyzing social media data, such as the number of likes, shares, and comments, as well as the sentiment expressed in social media posts, startups can gain a better understanding of the factors that drive investor interest and participation in ICOs. Furthermore, a study on social media could also shed light on the effectiveness of different social media platforms for promoting ICOs and engaging with investors. Overall, a comprehensive study that considers the impact of social media on ICO success would provide valuable insights for startups looking to raise funds through ICOs.

Influencer-driven product tweets significantly influence brand trust and consumer decisions. Twitter discussions bolster brand recognition and attract new audiences, leading to increased sales \cite{appel2020future}. Our study aims to comprehensively explore global social media strategies' impact on ICO success, contrasting with regional studies \cite{chursook2022twitter}. Understanding social media's influence aids startups in refining marketing strategies and engaging with investors. Analyzing social media metrics and sentiment guides effective investor targeting and platform selection for ICO promotion. A holistic social media study offers invaluable insights for ICO fundraising efforts.



% \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

\section{Hypotheses}
Hypothesis 1: Positive sentiment expressed in tweets mentioning an ICO is correlated with its success. Sentiment analysis of tweets can provide valuable insights into public perception of a cryptocurrency project. The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon can be used to analyse the emotional content of tweets and identify positive and negative sentiments. A higher proportion of positive tweets is likely to indicate a successful ICO. Sentiment analysis can be performed by collecting and analyzing tweets mentioning the ICO and their respective replies. Table \ref{tab1} illustrates some examples of original and reply tweet data that were used for the analysis.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Example of data used for sentiment analysis.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & \textbf{Tweet Content} & \textbf{Sentiment} \\
 \hline

& feeling great about this investment!! & \\
\hline

& develops, but currently looking for & \\
&  better options in the market & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Hypothesis 2: The level of engagement on social media, such as the number of mentions, retweets, likes, and followers, is positively associated with the success of an ICO. Engagement on social media can indicate the level of awareness and interest in a cryptocurrency project among potential investors. By collecting data on the number of mentions, retweets, likes, and followers of the project and the users mentioning it, we can measure the level of engagement and use it to predict the success of an ICO. Table \ref{tab2} illustrates an example of the engagement metrics used, and the number of each metric collected for the \$MATIC crypto token.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Example of data used for engagement metrics.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Data collected for \$MATIC} \\
\hline

\hline
Number of retweets & 1,471,118 \\
\hline
Number of likes & 1,280,414 \\
\hline
Number of project followers & 34,755,686 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab2}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Dataset}

ICOs data was collected from iconbench\footnote{\url{www.icobench.com}} and cryptoran\footnote{\url{www.cryptorank.io}} using a combination of manual download and automatic scraping using Python beautiful soup package\footnote{\url{https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/}}. For each cryptocurrency project, we recorded ICO-related data as summarized in Table \ref{tab3}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{center}
\end{table}

%Twitter data was collected using the Twitter API and Scrapy, a Python open-source framework. There were two types of tweets collected: firstly, those containing the keyword for a cryptocurrency project, which was identified with the prefix "\$" followed by the token name, such as "\$SOL" or "\$MATIC", and also tweets from the project's official Twitter account. For each tweet mentioning the token keyword, the number of retweets, likes, and followers of the poster, as well as the contents of the replies were collected. Tweets from the project’s Twitter account were not directly used as they could be considered announcements and posts made by the cryptocurrency project team and should not be considered as relevant to the hypotheses.

Data from Twitter was gathered using the Twitter API and Scrapy\footnote{\url{https://scrapy.org/}}, an open-source Python framework. The collection encompassed two categories of tweets: those that included a cryptocurrency project's keyword, marked by the prefix ``\$'' followed by the token's name (e.g., ``\$SOL'' or ``\$MATIC''), and tweets emanating from the project's official Twitter handle. For tweets featuring the token keyword, we compiled data on the number of retweets, likes, and the poster's follower count, in addition to the content of any responses. However, tweets originating from the project’s own account were excluded from direct analysis as they primarily represent official communications from the cryptocurrency project's team, thus deemed not directly pertinent to the research hypotheses.

%Tweets can be classified into two types: direct and indirect mentions. A tweet is classified as a direct mention if the token keyword is included in it. A tweet is classified as an indirect mention if it is in reply to a tweet that contains the token keyword, or if it is in reply to a tweet from the project's official Twitter account. It should be noted that to prevent look-ahead bias, only tweets created before a token's ICOs dates are relevant for estimating the potential success of the ICOs.

Tweets are categorized into direct mentions and indirect mentions. A direct mention occurs when a tweet explicitly contains the token keyword. An indirect mention refers to a tweet that either responds to another tweet featuring the token keyword or replies to a tweet from the project's official Twitter handle. It's important to highlight that to avoid look-ahead bias, only tweets published prior to the dates of a token's ICO are considered relevant for assessing the ICO's prospective success.

After collecting the above data, we processed and transformed it to obtain useful information. For each cryptocurrency project, we recorded the following twitter data as summarized in Table \ref{tab4}:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Twitter data collected.}

\end{table}

\section{Experiment \& Methodology}

\subsection{Data Processing}
%To better cater to machine learning models used in investigating the two proposed hypotheses, we processed and transformed the data into trainable formats.

For the facilitation of machine learning algorithms in the examination of our hypotheses, data preprocessing was undertaken to convert the raw data into a format amenable to algorithmic training.

%Firstly, we employed sentiment classification to determine the sentiment of the contents from direct mentions and indirect mentions. The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon, which contains terms and their connections to the two sentiment types (positive and negative), was used. The emotional polarity of each tweet was determined using this lexicon scale through Python programming language and its corresponding package, such as NLTK or TextBlob. The NRC Emotion Lexicon, which is specifically designed for Twitter, assigned a real-valued emotion score to each word. Figure \ref{fig1} shows an example of the resulting sentiment ratings of the Kyber Network (\$KNC) ICO.

Sentiment analysis was a pivotal component of our study, aimed at capturing the emotional undercurrents embedded in both overt and covert mentions. This was achieved by leveraging the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon\footnote{\url{https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm}}, a compendium that assigns sentiments—either positive or negative—to various words. We utilized TextBlob\footnote{\url{https://textblob.readthedocs.io/}}, a Python library recognized for its simple API that enables execution of several natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis. This was instrumental in quantifying the sentiment polarity of each tweet. Figure \ref{fig1} provides a visual representation of the sentiment evaluation conducted on tweets pertaining to the DUO Network (DUO) ICO.

%An ICO was considered successful if the total fund raised exceeded the soft cap (minimum amount of funding required by a project). The determination of an ICO's success was made by comparing the total fund raised and the soft cap value. As such, among the 57 analyzed ICOs, we categorized 34 of them as successful and 23 of them as unsuccessful ICOs. The resulting file has 12 columns, with each row representing data from the ICO of a cryptocurrency project. The columns are summarised in Table \ref{tab5}, which is in the Appendix.

The success of an ICO was quantitatively determined by comparing the total capital raised against the soft cap defined by the project, with the latter serving as the minimum required funding level. In our corpus of 816 ICOs, 582 were classified as having achieved success by surpassing their respective soft caps, whereas 234 were deemed unsuccessful for not meeting these financial benchmarks. The dataset was structured into 12 columns, each representing a discrete attribute of an ICO from a specific cryptocurrency project. A condensed overview of these attributes is delineated in Table \ref{tab5}, which can be found in the Appendix.

\subsection{Machine Learning Methods}

The objective of the current research was to forecast the potential success of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) by categorizing them as likely to succeed or not. This was based on an array of input variables, all represented by integer values, including attributes like 'soft\_cap', 'total\_positive\_direct\_mentions', among others. We segmented the data into two distinct groups: one for training, constituting 80\% of the entire dataset, and the other for testing, making up the remaining 20\%. Our methodological approach encompassed the deployment of six diverse algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), and Neural Network. These methods were selected for their proven competency in executing classification tasks. The process of parameter optimization was conducted through grid search with the aim of maximizing accuracy.

%In this study, we aimed to predict the success of an ICO (classify whether an ICO is going to be successful or not) using various input variables, all of which are integer values such as soft\_cap, total\_positive\_direct\_mentions, etc. To achieve this, we divided the dataset into two subsets - a training subset and a testing subset, accounting for 80\% and 20\% of the total, respectively. We utilized six different methods - Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), and Neural Network. These techniques were chosen based on their effectiveness in handling classification tasks. Parameters were chosen with grid search and accuracy as the objective function.

%To evaluate the performance of each model, we employed 5-fold cross-validation, which divides the data into five equal parts. Four parts of the divided data were used to train the predictive model, while the remaining section was used to evaluate the model's performance. This approach ensures that the model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data, thus reducing the risk of overfitting.


\section{Results \& Discussion}

\subsection{Individual hypothesis testing}
The classification methods were first applied to hypothesis 1 - ``Positive sentiment expressed in tweets mentioning an ICO is correlated with its success'' by using only the x variables directly linked to sentiments (variables 2, 3, 5, 6 in Table \ref{tab5}). Table \ref{tab6} illustrates the performance outcomes of each predictive model. 

%A comparison with existing model built on local sentiment(11) is shown in figure 2.

Next, the same methods were applied to hypothesis 2 - ``The level of engagement on social media, such as the number of mentions, retweets, likes, and followers, is positively associated with the success of an ICO'' by using the remaining variables which are directly linked to level of engagement. Table \ref{tab7} presents the performance outcomes for each predictive model.

The results shown in Table \ref{tab6} suggest that the models trained to test Hypothesis 1 yielded moderate performance scores, with the highest accuracy achieved by the Neural Network model at 74.4\%. The F1 Scores ranged from 70.9\% to 81.9\%, which is moderately high. These results indicate that Hypothesis 1 has some merit and performs decently in predicting the success of ICOs based on positive sentiment expressed in tweets.

In contrast, the models trained to test Hypothesis 2 in Table \ref{tab7} performed better overall, with the highest accuracy achieved by the Random Forest model at 76.8\%. The Precision and Recall scores for all models were relatively high, ranging from 65.2\% to 82.9\% for Precision and 58.9\% to 100.0\% for Recall, respectively. The F1 Scores ranged from 68.9\% to 83.5\%, which is slightly higher than the accuracy/F1 scores achieved in the models trained to test Hypothesis 1. These results suggest that while sentiment expressed through tweets may be a moderately strong predictor of ICO success (hypothesis 1), the level of engagement a crypto project has on social media might act as a better predictor (hypothesis 2), supporting the plausibility of hypothesis 2 over hypothesis 1.

\subsection{Combined hypotheses testing}
A combination of the feature sets from both hypotheses was tested for predictive power. This appeared to improve the overall performance, particularly for the CatBoost model, as seen in Table \ref{tab8}. 
%A comparison with existing model built on local sentiment and expert opinion is shown in figure 4.

%The performance of the proposed model seems to be lacking in comparison to the related work's. This could be due to the difference in taking global data compared to local data only. 

%Overall, the results suggest that both Hypothesis 1 and 2 may have value in predicting the success of ICOs, especially when used together. The CatBoost model performed the best overall in terms of accuracy.

The findings indicate that both Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 could be effective in forecasting ICO success, particularly when applied in conjunction. Among the tested models, CatBoost and Random Forest emerged as the top performers in accuracy.

\subsection{Further Discussion}

There are several potential reasons why the level of engagement on social media may be a more reliable predictor of the success of an ICO than positive sentiment expressed in tweets. One reason is that the level of engagement on social media is a more comprehensive measure of interest and support for a project, considering factors such as the number of mentions, retweets, likes, and followers \cite{albrecht2019sentiment}. Positive sentiment expressed in tweets, on the other hand, may not capture all forms of engagement and may be influenced by factors such as bots and fake accounts \cite{mirtaheri2021identifying}.

Furthermore, the sentiment expressed in tweets may not always reflect the true feelings and opinions of the wider community \cite{fi12030060}. For example, some people may not reply to tweets or publicly express their support or interest in a project, but may still be engaged with the project on other levels, such as following its social media pages or participating in ICOs and purchasing the tokens without posting anything on Twitter. In contrast, the level of engagement on social media provides a more comprehensive and holistic view of the level of interest and engagement in a project.

Another potential reason why positive sentiment expressed in tweets may not be as strong an indicator of success as the level of engagement on social media is that sentiment can be influenced by a variety of factors, including competitors, influencers, and external events. For example, a project that is in direct competition with another project may receive a high volume of negative sentiment simply because of the rivalry, even if the project itself is strong and has potential for success. Therefore, sentiment expressed in tweets may not always accurately reflect the actual quality and potential of a project.

Another point to consider is that negative sentiment expressed on social media can sometimes have unintended positive effects. In the age of information overload, negative tweets or comments may grab more attention than positive ones and can generate buzz and discussion around a project, leading to increased visibility and exposure \cite{freeman2018enhancing}. It is also important to note that bad marketing is still marketing, and negative sentiment can still create awareness and interest in a project. Therefore, when evaluating the potential success of a project, it is essential to consider both positive and negative sentiment expressed on social media. While positive sentiment is a good indicator of potential success, it should not be the sole metric to evaluate a project, as it can be influenced by external factors such as competitors or influencers. Ultimately, a more comprehensive view of sentiment and engagement on social media is necessary to accurately evaluate the potential success of a project.

Overall, the level of engagement on social media appears to be a more reliable predictor of the success of an ICO than positive sentiment expressed in tweets. The comprehensive and holistic nature of engagement metrics such as mentions, retweets, likes, and followers, combined with their relative independence from external factors such as competition and sentiment, make them a more robust and reliable measure of interest and support for a project.

Our findings highlight the crucial role of social media engagement in predicting ICO success, suggesting a strategic focus on enhancing online interactions. ICO projects should prioritize increasing social media activities like mentions, retweets, and followers to attract and sustain interest. A concise strategy would involve creating engaging content, managing active communities, and collaborating with influencers to amplify visibility. This approach underscores the importance of both engagement quantity and sentiment quality, guiding projects to optimize their social media presence for better funding outcomes.

\section{Conclusion}
%This study examined the impact of twitter sentiment and engagement level on the success of ICOs fundraising. Positive sentiment on Twitter was found to be associated with higher levels of fundraising success. Twitter is widely used as a platform for promoting ICOs and for investors to gather news and information on cryptocurrency and related topics. The study found that ICOs with more positive comments and discussions on Twitter were more likely to raise larger amounts of funds. Strong correlations were found between an ICO's fundraising and its Twitter sentiment and the number of direct and indirect followers of a crypto project. The study used four classifiers (NB, SVM, LR, and RF) to predict accuracy, with Random Forest being the best model as it has the highest scores in 3 out of 4 performance evaluation results.

This research explores how Twitter sentiment and engagement influence ICO fundraising outcomes. It was discovered that a positive sentiment on Twitter correlates with greater fundraising achievements. Twitter serves as a crucial channel for ICO promotion and a source for investors to obtain cryptocurrency-related information. The findings indicate that ICOs receiving more positive commentary and engagement on Twitter tend to secure higher funding amounts. Notably, a strong relationship was observed between the fundraising success of an ICO and both its Twitter sentiment and the volume of its direct and indirect followers. To assess predictive accuracy, six classifiers were employed: Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Categorical Boosting, and Neural Network. Among these, Random Forest and Categorical Boosting emerged as the most effective, leading in performance across two of the four evaluation metrics.

In addition to the current research, there are still many avenues to explore regarding the impact of social media on ICO success. One potential area of future work is to investigate "pump and dump" ICO projects, where the followers and their respective interactions are likely to be AI bots and paid Twitter accounts, specially paid to pump the projects. These types of projects have been known to manipulate social media sentiment and create an artificial hype around the project, leading to short-term gains but ultimately resulting in significant losses for unsuspecting investors. Understanding the impact of these tactics on ICO success could be valuable in detecting and avoiding such fraudulent projects.

Another area for future research is to explore how a few extremely influential figures can single-handedly affect the price of a crypto project. The impact of these influential figures on social media sentiment can be significant and may lead to short-term gains or losses for investors. Studying the impact of such influencers on ICO success could provide insights into the role of individual powerhouses in the cryptocurrency market and could lead to a better understanding of how to mitigate risks associated with their influence. 

Additionally, further research is needed to explore the connection between social media marketing expenses and the financial performance of ICO projects. Investigating how an ICO's governance signals influence fundraising success can provide valuable insights into key success factors. Furthermore, understanding the broader impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies on businesses is crucial for predicting the future of ICOs.
